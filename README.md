puccini-tosca
-------------

Clout frontend for TOSCA. Parses a TOSCA service template and compiles it to Clout (see below).

Why TOSCA? It's a high-level language designed exactly for modeling and validating cloud topologies
with reusable and inheritable objects. It allows architects to focus on application logic and
requirements without being bogged down by the ever-changing specificities of the infrastructure.
We support TOSCA 1.1 as well as the recent draft of TOSCA 1.2.

**puccini-tosca** comes with TOSCA profiles for the
[Kubernetes](assets/tosca/profiles/kubernetes/1.0/) and
[OpenStack](assets/tosca/profiles/openstack/1.0/) cloud infrastructures, as well as
[BPMN processes](assets/tosca/profiles/bpmn/1.0/).
These include node, capability, relationship, policy, and other types, as well as straightforward
JavaScript code to provide orchestration integrations.
Also included are detailed [examples](examples/README.md) using these profiles to get you started.

We support
[CSAR files](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.1/os/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.1-os.html#_Toc489606742)
(TOSCA packages) in addition to YAML files. We're even including a simple CSAR creation tool,
**puccini-csar**.

How do TOSCA, Clout, JavaScript, and cloud infrastructures all fit together in Puccini? Consider
this: with a single command line you can take a TOSCA service template, compile it with
**puccini-tosca**, pipe the Clout through the **puccini-js** processor, which will run JavaScript to
generate Kubernetes specs, then pipe those to
[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/),
which will finally upload the specs to a running Kubernetes cluster. Like so:

     puccini-tosca compile my-app.yaml | puccini-js exec kubernetes.generate | kubectl apply -f -

Et voil√†, your abstract design became a running deployment.

### Standalone Parser

Puccini's [TOSCA parser](tosca/parser/) is available as an independent Go library. Its 6 phases do
normalization, validation, inheritance, and assignment of TOSCA's many types and templates, finally
satisfying requirements with capabilities, resulting in a
[flat, serializable data structure](tosca/normal/) that can easily be consumed by your
program. Validation error messages are precise and useful. It's a very, very fast parser, enough
that it can be usefully embedded in editors and IDEs for validating TOSCA while typing.

TOSCA is a complex object-oriented language. Considerable effort has been put into adhering to every
aspect the grammar, especially in regards to value type checking and type inheritance contracts.

### Compiler

The TOSCA-to-Clout compiler just takes the parsed data structure and dumps it into Clout. It also
includes any JavaScript required to process the Clout. Thusly Clout functions as an "intermediate
representation" (IR) for TOSCA.

puccini-js
----------

Clout processor for JavaScript. Executes existing JavaScript in a Clout file. For example, it can
execute the Kubernetes spec generation code inserted by **puccini-tosca**. It also supports
executing intrinsic functions and value constraints (for example, TOSCA's).

Also supported are implementation-specific JavaScript "plugins" that allow you to extend existing
functionality. For example, you can add a plugin for Kubernetes to handle custom application needs,
such as adding sidecars, routers, loadbalancers, etc. Indeed, Istio support is implemented as a
plugin. You can also use **puccini-js** to add plugins to the Clout file, either storing them
permanently or piping through to add and execute them on-the-fly.

### TOSCA Intrinsic Functions and Constraints

These are implemented in JavaScript so that they can be put into the Clout and then be executed
by **puccini-js**, allowing a compiled-from-TOSCA Clout file to be entirely independent from TOSCA.
The Clout lives on its own.

To call these functions we provide the **tosca.coerce** JavaScript, which calls all functions and
replaces the call stubs with the returned values:

    puccini-js exec tosca.coerce my-clout.yaml --output=coerced-clout.yaml

A useful side benefit of this implementation is we allow you to easily extend TOSCA by
[adding your own functions/constraints](examples/javascript/functions.yaml). Obviously, such custom
functions are not part of the TOSCA spec and will not be compatible with other TOSCA
implementations.

### TOSCA Attributes

TOSCA attributes (as opposed to properties) represent live data in a running deployment. And the
intrinsic function, `get_attribute`, allows other values to make use of this live data. The
implication is that some values in the Clout should change as these attributes change. But also,
attribute definitions in TOSCA allow you to define constraints on the value, so we must also make
sure that the new data complies with them.

Our solution has two steps. First, we have JavaScript (**kubernetes.update**) that extracts these
attributes from a Kubernetes cluster (by calling **kubectl**) and updates the Clout. Second, we
run **tosca.coerce**, which not only calls instrinsic functions but also applies the constraints.

Putting it all together, let's refresh a Clout:

    puccini-js exec kubernetes.update my-clout.yaml | puccini-js exec tosca.coerce -o coerced-clout.yaml

### TOSCA Workflows, Operations, and Policy Triggers

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

TOSCA workflows are an abstraction of task graphs that are tightly coupled with the topology. They
represent the "classical" orchestration paradigm, which procedurally (in serial and/or in parallel)
executes individual self-contained operations that when successful achieve a total state for an
application. This paradigm is notoriously bad at handling failure, which may leave components in
various states and the application as a whole at an indeterminate one. Such breakage must usually
be fixed manually, or else require a complete automated reset of the application involving painful
downtime. Oh, well. Until this paradigm is replaced with more cloud-native solutions across all
cloud infrastructures, we're going to have to live with it.  

TOSCA Profiles in Puccini may come with built-in domain-specific "normative" workflows. For example,
OpenStack has workflows to provision and remove its resources. TOSCA 1.1 further introduced custom
workflows, often used for scaling, healing, upgrading, backing up, and reconfiguration. Policy
triggers are a related feauture, as they specify an event or condition that could launch a workflow
or an individual operation.

Puccini provides three different implementations of these features:

For OpenStack, Puccini can generate [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks that rely on the
Ansible OpenStack roles. Custom operation artifacts, if included, are deployed to the virtual
machines and executed. Effectively, the combination of TOSCA + Ansible provides an equivalent set of
features to
[HOT](https://docs.openstack.org/heat/latest/template_guide/hot_guide.html) +
[Heat](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat). Indeed, it's worth pointing out that the HOT language
is superficially and historically related to TOSCA. Actually, TOSCA + Ansible is more powerful and
flexible, because the TOSCA language is much richer than HOT, and Ansible is a general-purpose
orchestrator that can do a lot more than Heat. The generated playbooks comprise roles that can be
imported and used in other playbooks.

Puccini's BPMN profile lets you generate [BPMN2](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/) processes from
TOSCA workflows and policy triggers. These allow for tight integration with enterprise process
management (called [OSS/BSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSS/BSS) in the telecommunications
industry). The generated processes can also be included as sub-processes within larger business
processes. 

Kubernetes doesn't normally require workflows: its "scheduling" paradigm is a declarative
alternative to the "classical" procedural orchestration paradigm. As it provides a truly
cloud-native environment, Kubernetes applications are better off orchestrating themselves, for
example by relying on [operators](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) to do the
heavy lifting. Still, it could make sense to use workflows for certain externally triggered
features. Puccini's solution is straightforward: it can generate an Ansible playbook that deploys
artifacts with `kubectl cp` and executes them with `kubectl exec`.

Clout
-----

Introducing the **clou**d **t**opology ("clou" + "t") representation language, which can be
formatted as YAML/JSON/XML.

Clout is an intermediary format for your deployments. As an analogy, consider a program written in
the C language. First, you must *compile* the C source into machine code for your hardware
architecture. Then, you *link* the compiled object, together with various libraries, into a
deployable executable for a specific target platform. Clout here is the compiled object. If you only
care about the final result then you won't see the Clout at all. However, this decoupling allows for
a more powerful tool chain. For example, some tools might change your Clout after the initial
compilation (to scale out, to optimize, to add platform hooks, debugging features, etc.) and then
you just need to "re-link" in order to update your deployment. This can happen without requiring
you to update your original source design. It may also possible to "de-compile" some cloud
deployments so that you can generate a Clout without "source code".

Clout is essentially a big, unopinionated, implementation-specific dump of vertexes and the edges
between them with un-typed, non-validated properties. Rule #1 of Clout is that everything and the
kitchen sink should be in one Clout file. Really, anything goes: specifications, configurations,
metadata, annotations, source code, documentation, and even text-encoded binaries. (The only
possible exception might be that you would want to store security certificates and keys
elsewhere.)

In itself Clout is an unremarkable format. Think of it as a way to gather various deployment specs
for disparate technologies in one place while allowing for the *relationships* (edges) between
entities to be specified and annotated. That's the topology.

Clout is not supposed to be human-readable or human-manageable. The idea is to use tools (Clout
frontends and processors) to deal with its complexity. We have some great ones for you here. For
example, with Puccini you can use just a little bit of TOSCA to generate a single big Clout file
that describes a complex Kubernetes service mesh.

If Clout's file size is an issue, it's good to know that Clout is usually eminently compressible,
comprising just text with quite a lot of repetition.

FAQ
---

### Can Puccini deploy my existing TOSCA to Kubernetes or OpenStack?

If you didn't plan it that way, then: no. Our TOSCA Kubernetes/OpenStack profiles do *not* make use
of TOSCA's
[Simple Profile](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.1/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.1.html)
or [Simple Profile for NFV](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/tosca-nfv/v1.0/tosca-nfv-v1.0.html)
types (Compute, BlockStorage, VDU, etc.). Still, if you find these so-called "normative" types
useful, they are included in Puccini and will be compiled into Clout. You may write your own
JavaScript to deploy them to your cloud orchestration environment. But, we encourage you to consider
carefully whether this is a good idea. We think it's a dead end.

Generally speaking, the notion that a single set of normative types could be used for all the
various cloud and container platforms out there is a pipe dream. The devil is in the details, and
the amount of detail needed for cloud deployment keeps growing and diversifying. Thus every Clout
file is vehemently platform-specific. However, by bringing the tiniest implementation details all
into one place we can at least have a common tool chain for all platforms. That's the gist of
Puccini.

### JavaScript? Really?

The decision to use an interpreted programming language is intentional and important. Unlike some
Kubernetes tools ([Helm](https://helm.sh/)), we do not treat YAML files as plain text to be
manipulated by an anemic text templating language, where working around YAML's strict
indentation is a nightmare.

JavaScript lets you manipulate data structures directly using a full-blown, conventional language.
It's probably
[not anyone's favorite language](https://archive.org/details/wat_destroyallsoftware), but it's
familiar, mature, standardized (as [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript)), and does
the job. From a certain angle it's essentially Scheme (because it has powerful closures and
functions are first class citizens), just with a crusty C syntax.

And because JavaScript is self-contained text, it's trivial to store it in a Clout file, which can
then be interpreted and run almost anywhere.

Our chosen ECMAScript engine is [goja](https://github.com/dop251/goja), which is 100% Go and does
not require any external dependencies.

### Can't I use simple text templating instead of intrinsic functions and JavaScript?

Nothing is stopping you. You can pipe the input and output to and from the text translator of your
choice at any point in the tool chain. Here's an example using
[gomplate](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate):

    puccini-tosca compile my-app.yaml | gomplate | puccini-js exec kubernetes.generate

Your TOSCA can then inject expressions into values, such as `username: "{{.Env.USER}}"`.

Just make sure that your templating engine can emit valid YAML where appropriate (for example, it
should be able to escape quotation marks).

A useful convention could be to add a file extension to mark a file for text template processing.
For example, `.yaml.j2` could be recognized as requiring Jinja2 template processing, after which the
`.j2` extension would be stripped.

### Can I compose a single service from several interrelated Clout files?

Clout intentionally does *not* support service composition. Each Clout file is its own universe. If
you need to create edges between vertexes in one Clout file and vertexes in other Clout files, then
it's up to you and your tools to design and implement that integration. The solution could be very
elaborate indeed: the two Clouts might represent services with very different lifecycles, that run
in different clouds, that are handled by different orchestrators. And the connection might require
complex networking to achieve. There's simply no one-size-fits-all way Puccini could do
it‚Äînamespaces? proxies? catalogs? repositories?‚Äîso it insists on not having an opinion.

TOSCA has a feature called "substitution mapping", which is useful for modeling service composition.
However, it's a design feature. The implementation, which would likely be very complex, is up to
your orchestration tool chain. See our examples
[here](examples/grammar/substitution-mapping.yaml) and
[here](examples/grammar/substitution-mapping-client.yaml).

### TOSCA is so complicated! Help?

I know, right? Now imagine writing a parser for it... Not only is it a complex language, but the
[spec itself](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.1/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.1.html)
(as of version 1.1) has many contradictions, errors, and gaps.

To help you out we've included [examples](examples/grammar/) of TOSCA core grammatical features,
with some running commentary. Treat them as your playground. Also, if you have 4 hours to spare,
grab some snacks, get comfortable, and watch this free online course for TOSCA 1.0:
[part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMkqLI6o-58),
[part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xGmpi--7-A).

(Author's note: This is actually my second take at writing a TOSCA parser, after learning a great
deal from my previous efforts in [AriaTosca](https://github.com/apache/incubator-ariatosca), an
incubation project under the Apache Software Foundation. I am grateful to
[Cloudify](https://cloudify.co/) for funding much of the AriaTosca effort. Note, however, that
Puccini is a fresh start initiated by myself with no commercial backing. It does not use any of the
AriaTosca code and has a radically different architecture as well as very different goals.)

### Why doesn't the TOSCA parser tell me which line number in the relevant file a problem occurred?

Unfortunately, [our YAML parser](https://gopkg.in/yaml.v2) doesn't expose this information. There
is an [open issue](https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/issues/108) for it, and if it's resolved we will
add this important feature in the future.

### Why is it called "Puccini"?

[Giacomo Puccini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini) was the composer of the
[*Tosca*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosca) opera (based on Victorien Sardou's play,
[*La Tosca*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Tosca)), as well as *La boh√®me*, *Madama Butterfly*,
and other famous works. The theme here is orchestration, orchestras, composition, and thus operas.
Capiche?
