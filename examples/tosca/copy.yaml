# "copy" is a convience feature that works like a YAML copy-and-paste
# It is available for both node templates and relationship templates
# The YAML is copied from the source to the target *before* applying the changes
# This can happen recursively,
# Though Puccini does make sure to report a problem if you are copying in a loop
