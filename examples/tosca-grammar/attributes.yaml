    # Unlike "properties", you can't mark an attribute as required or not
    # Attributes are *always* added to the node template, even if they have not been assigned
    # If they don't have a "default" value, they will get an automatic, sensible default
    # (E.g., a string will get an empty string)
    # But this might not always match constraints, which would result in an error
    # So in some cases you might have to explicitly assign a default
