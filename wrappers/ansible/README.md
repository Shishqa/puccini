Ansible Wrapper for Puccini
===========================

An [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) collection, [packaged for Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/puccini/tosca).

This relies on the [Python wrapper](../../wrappers/python/), so make sure to install that first.

The latest stable version is published on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/puccini/tosca). To install:

    ansible-galaxy collection install puccini.tosca

Also see: [Ansible examples](../../examples/ansible/).
